This is a frontend of a holtel booking application. The appplication is deployed [here](https://65ad855a7f6077a721dc046c--tangerine-haupia-e1cfff.netlify.app/).
User can sign up as a client who can book a room and search for available roomes, based on a city or hotel name, capacity of a room and desired dates. Owner clients will be able to make new hotels, edit and delete hotels, and make, adit and delete rooms for those hotels. Admin clients will be able to remove rooms and hotels. These functionalities are still not developed.
